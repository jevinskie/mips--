# mips--
A dual core MIPS subset CPU written in behavioral, synthesizable VHDL

MIPS-- is an implementation of a subset of MIPS in VHDL targeting a Altera DE2 development board. It was implemented in the [two process methodology described by Jiri Gaisler](http://www.gaisler.com/doc/vhdl2proc.pdf). The final implementation includes I-cache, D-cache, and dual cores with ll/sc synchronization instructions.

More information can be found in the [final report](final_report/final_report_jsweval.pdf).
